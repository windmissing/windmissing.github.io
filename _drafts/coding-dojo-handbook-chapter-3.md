# Dojo Principles
1. One can't discuss a form without code.\n One can't show code without tests.
2. find a master for the form
3. do it, explain share what you learned
4. learn again
5. can't go faster and learn at the same time, so **slow down**
6. Throw yourself in 没看懂
7. 服从master
8. master a subject

## Drive Development with tests
gradually build up a piece of code to solve a problem that is too big to solve one goal
## refactor safely
make a sequence of tiny safe changes that add up to a larger design improvement
## Design Test Case
being readable, robust, faster
## Design Clean code
code is readable
language idiom and styles
